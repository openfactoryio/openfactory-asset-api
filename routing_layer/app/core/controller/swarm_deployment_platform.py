"""
Swarm Deployment Backend for Dynamic Service Management.

This module implements the `SwarmDeploymentPlatform`, a concrete deployment backend
based on Docker Swarm. It supports dynamically deploying and removing service containers
for processing groups in a distributed architecture.

Features:
    - Deployment of per-group FastAPI services as Docker Swarm services.
    - Central routing layer API deployment to interface with all group services.
    - Docker Swarm health and manager node verification during initialization.
    - Environment-aware endpoint resolution (supports 'local' and production modes).
    - CPU resource constraints and Kafka stream configuration injection.

Intended Use:
    - Designed to run as part of the routing layer in OpenFactory's streaming pipeline.
    - Should only be used in environments where Docker Swarm mode is active and the
      node is part of a manager quorum.

Dependencies:
    - Docker SDK for Python (`docker`)
    - OpenFactory `settings` module for runtime configuration
    - Custom logging via `get_logger`

Raises:
    - RuntimeError if Docker Swarm is not active or misconfigured at startup.

Note:
    - Services are named using the prefix "stream-api-group-" followed by a sanitized
      group name to maintain uniqueness and DNS-safe formatting.

        - Supports a 'local' mode (settings.environment == "local") where the routing
          API runs locally, while group services run inside the Swarm cluster.
